# Project Idea 1

Our application displays a gallery of tasty homemade dishes. You can browse the gallery to view the dishes' information and add dishes you like to your favorites list. You can also manage the dishes on your favorites list. Favorites list will be stored locally to allow users to revisit their previously favorited dishes.

Pain points:

- Convienience of choosing meals to prepare

- Easy access recipes for interesting dishes

- Ability to save interesting dishes

# Scope

## In:

- Show users gallery of tasty dishes

- Allow users to view dish recipes, ingredients, and instructions

- Allow users to curate a selection of favorite dishes in their favorites page

## Out:

- Does not generate gallery based of favorites list

- Does not show all dish origin info or locations dishes are served

- Does not use large database of pre-loaded dishes
