# Project Idea 1

Our application displays a gallery of skateboard parks. You can browse the gallery to view the park's name and location, watch a video of people skating there, and add it to your favorites list. You can also manage parks on your favorites list and view them on a google map. Favorites list will be stored locally to allow users to revisit their previously favorited parks.

Pain points:

- Covinience of viewing and saving popular skate spots

- See how close or far away popular skate spots are from you on a google map

- Watch clips of people skating before planning a trip to the spot

# MVP

- Minimun viable product will display gallery of selected skateparks to view. Hovering over a skatepark in the gallery will make the name appear as well as buttons to favorite the dish and view a video. Favorited parks will be recorded on the favorites page and favorites will be persisted across all pages of the website in local storage.
