Our application displays a gallery of tasty homemade dishes. You can browse the gallery to view the dishes' information and add dishes you like to your favorites list. You can also manage the dishes on your favorites list. Favorites list will be stored locally to allow users to revisit their previously favorited dishes.

Pain points:

- Convienience of choosing meals to prepare

- Easy access recipes for interesting dishes

- Ability to save interesting dishes
